While making a project in electronics or developing a product, PCB plays a major role. After producing the PCB, the next step is to assemble them. While assembling a PCB with SMD components we must use the Solder paste. While SMD stencils are the best way to apply the solder paste to the PCB, it might be not that easy to get one, especially from local PCB manufacturers. So, the Next option is to apply the solder paste manually, and it will be a real pain stacking process especially if there are so many components.  So are you a hobbyist looking for a simple solution to dispense solder paste quickly? 
In this project, we are going to make such a device. We will be using bare minimum components such as a microcontroller, OLED display, motor driver and the miniature geared dc motor along with some 3D printed parts. With a clear and straightforward UI, this device is made to be user-friendly. It is the best option for a variety of tasks since it can properly and quickly dispense solder paste. Thanks to its adjustable speed and dispensing rate, we can fine-tune the amount of solder paste getting dispensed.
